Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. These systems are capable of performing tasks such as problem-solving, pattern recognition, language understanding, and decision-making.
AI systems are broadly categorized into narrow AI and general AI. Narrow AI focuses on specific tasks such as image recognition or speech processing, while general AI aims to perform any intellectual task that a human can do.
The growth of AI has been driven by increased computational power, availability of large datasets, and advancements in machine learning algorithms.

Machine Learning Fundamentals
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on enabling machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms identify patterns in data and improve performance through experience.
There are three main types of machine learning:
Supervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning
Reinforcement Learning
Supervised learning involves labeled datasets, whereas unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. Reinforcement learning focuses on learning optimal actions through rewards and penalties.

Deep Learning and Neural Networks
Deep Learning is a specialized branch of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple hidden layers. These networks are inspired by the structure of the human brain.
Neural networks consist of input layers, hidden layers, and output layers. Each neuron applies a weighted sum followed by an activation function to produce outputs.
Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

Applications of Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence is widely used across various industries:
Healthcare (disease diagnosis, medical imaging)
Finance (fraud detection, algorithmic trading)
Transportation (autonomous vehicles)
Education (personalized learning systems)
Despite its benefits, AI also presents challenges such as data privacy concerns, bias in algorithms, and ethical considerations.
